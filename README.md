# search_api_solr_pro
Module extension to prevent the entities being loaded from solr results in views by a query setting.

#### Motivation:
The well know module search_api_solr (https://www.drupal.org/project/search_api_solr) force the entities to beign loaded from the solr results in views, ignoring if the user only want to display specific fields that are already indexed in solr.
In that case we can improve the performance of view generation avoiding the load of the entities.

#### Install module
1. Clone the repo into the drupal module folder
2. Activate the module in the drupal admin section extend

8. Specified the indexed fields you want to use in the view (If the field is set as excluded for render then it will not be available in the view)


Note: In the twig file for the view you will find the fields in the row object, for example:

```TWIG
<li class="alpha-section__list-item">
  {% if title %}
    <h3>{{ title }}</h3>
  {% endif %}
  <ul class="alpha-section__sublist">
    {% for row in rows %}
      {%
      set row_classes = [
      default_row_class ? 'views-row',
      ]
      %}
      <li>
        {% set result_row = row.content['#row']|obj_to_arr %}
        {% set name = result_row['entity:authors/person_name'][0].getText() %}
        {% set url = result_row['search_api_id']|replace({':und': ''}) %}
        {{ link(name, url) }}
      </li>
    {% endfor %}
  </ul>
</li>
```
